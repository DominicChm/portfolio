excerpt: Making a wheelchair R/C
---

I picked up this old quantum wheelchair off my university's surplus for a grand total of 10$.
I replaced the controller with a completely custom ESP32+IBT2 driver which let me control it using a PS3 remote.
One day it'll be the base for an awesome project.
