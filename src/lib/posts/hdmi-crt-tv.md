excerpt: Adding HDMI input to a vintage B&W TV
---

For fun, I added an HDMI input to a vintage CRT TV so it can be used with modern PCs. Because it was RF-only and didn't have any exposed composite inputs, I performed some board-level mods to inject a composite signal after the RF demodulator. The module that performs the HDMI to Composite conversion is off-the-shelf and directly mounted inside the chassis.
