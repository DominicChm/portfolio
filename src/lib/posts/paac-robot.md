excerpt: Cotton-picking robot for the ASABE robotics competition

---

I mentored Cal Poly's Precision Agriculture Automation Club (PAAC) to develop a robot for the 2023 [ASABE Robotics Competition](https://asabe.org/Robotics). The robot, affectionately named "Ankle Biter", got Cal Poly 2nd place. 

It used a 360 degree LIDAR, coupled with a custom python-based driver, to navigate the playing field with closed-loop control. Cotton picking was performed using spined belts together with a vacuum fan salvaged from a Neato XV-11. 

Here's the collection mechanism:

<model-viewer

  environment-image="/portfolio/assets/environment.hdr"
  shadow-intensity="1"
  camera-controls
  touch-action="pan-y"
  orientation="0deg -90deg 0deg"
  class="w-full h-[30rem]"
/>

Check out our first run!

Far from perfect, but considering the robot was rebuilt from the ground up in the preceding 2 weeks it way outperformed expectations.

By the end of our run, our entire collection bin had filled up!
