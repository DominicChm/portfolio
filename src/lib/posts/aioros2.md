excerpt: A Pythonic way to interact with ROS2

If you've ever had to work with [Robot Operating System 2](https://www.ros.org/) (ROS2) you'll know that getting it set up is the least of your issues.
That's why I developed `aioros2`, which leverages [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) among other python features to wrap [rclpy](https://github.com/ros2/rclpy) in an intuitive, pythonic manner.
