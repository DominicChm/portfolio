# About Me
I'm a SoCal native with a knack for tinkering and a passion for all things engineering. I've been programming since I got my first Lego NXTs at age 9, designing circuits since my first DIY electric bike at age 12, and 3D modeling since my Architecture course in high school at age 14. 

I came to SLO to study Mechanical Engineering because I specifically appreciated Cal Poly's "learn by doing" approach to learning. Along the way, I joined Cal Poly Racing's Baja team (after the formula team's car's nosecone fell off during a demonstration) where I committed to furthering the programming and electrical engineering skills I wouldn't be learning in ME. Ultimately, I also picked up a CS minor.

In my work, I love to combine all aspects of engineering from the lowest level mechanical design and PCB component selection to the highest level website design.
